# NEAT+

The Nexus Environmental Assessment Tool [(NEAT+)](https://www.neatplus.org) is designed for humanitarian actors to quickly identify issues of environmental concern to make emergency and recovery interventions more sustainable. Hosted by the UNEP/OCHA Joint Environment Unit, the NEAT+ aims to reduce the environmental impact of humanitarian activities through standardized, comparable screenings.
